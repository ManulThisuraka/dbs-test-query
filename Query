Simple nested Loop Join : Cost:  ( M +  pR * M * N  )
Page oriented : Cost:  ( M + M*N )
Block nested loops join : Cost : ( M +N(M/B-2) )
Index nested loops join : Cost :  ( M + ( (M*pR) * cost of finding matching S tuples)) :: Index(2-4), Hash(1.2)


Cost = 2N * (Number of passes) : estimate total cost to execute query
In this sql query having table joining. In here 
merge table is work. In this table pass data in 
hard disk to the memory. For this reading and writing
pages are same. 

Ex : Cost = 2N * (Number of passes)
        = 3000 * 2 * 2
        = 12 000 I/O
